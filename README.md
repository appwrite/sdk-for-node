**This SDK is compatible with Appwrite server version 1.7.x. For older versions, please check [previous releases](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-node/releases).**

 > This is the Node.js SDK for integrating with Appwrite from your Node.js server-side code.
                            If you're looking to integrate from the browser, you should check [appwrite/sdk-for-web](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-web)

Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the Node.js SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools. For full API documentation and tutorials go to [https://appwrite.io/docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)

## Installation

To install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install node-appwrite --save
```


## Getting Started

### Init your SDK
Initialize your SDK with your Appwrite server API endpoint and project ID which can be found in your project settings page and your new API secret Key project API keys section.

```js
const sdk = require('node-appwrite');

let client = new sdk.Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1') // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject('5df5acd0d48c2') // Your project ID
    .setKey('919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2') // Your secret API key
    .setSelfSigned() // Use only on dev mode with a self-signed SSL cert
;
```

### Make Your First Request
Once your SDK object is set, create any of the Appwrite service objects and choose any request to send. Full documentation for any service method you would like to use can be found in your SDK documentation or in the [API References](https://appwrite.io/docs) section.

```js
let users = new sdk.Users(client);

let promise = users.create(sdk.ID.unique(), "email@example.com", "+123456789", "password", "Walter O'Brien");

promise.then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
}, function (error) {
    console.log(error);
});
```

### Full Example
```js
const sdk = require('node-appwrite');

let client = new sdk.Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1') // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject('5df5acd0d48c2') // Your project ID
    .setKey('919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2') // Your secret API key
    .setSelfSigned() // Use only on dev mode with a self-signed SSL cert
;

let users = new sdk.Users(client);
let promise = users.create(sdk.ID.unique(), "email@example.com", "+123456789", "password", "Walter O'Brien");

promise.then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
}, function (error) {
    console.log(error);
});
```

### Error Handling
The Appwrite Node SDK raises `AppwriteException` object with `message`, `code` and `response` properties. You can handle any errors by catching `AppwriteException` and present the `message` to the user or handle it yourself based on the provided error information. Below is an example.

```js
let users = new sdk.Users(client);

try {
    let res = await users.create(sdk.ID.unique(), "email@example.com", "+123456789", "password", "Walter O'Brien");
} catch(e) {
    console.log(e.message);
}
```
